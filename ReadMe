This is the frontend react native code of a robust disease detector application which was developed as a novel research area for the final year project at my university.
To make the full application work you will have to run both the frontend react native code and the backend python project as well.
I hosted the backend python flask project on a linux virtual machine on Azure and accessed it through my react native application.
